### How to play
Try to guess a Philadelphia themed word by guessing letters. To win, guess all the correct letters in the word. You're only allowed 10 wrong guesses. If you reach 10 incorrected letters guessed, you lose.

### How it was made
The word-guess-cli game was made using node.js and the Inquirer prompt. It was also put together with the help of [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnSgRvmTJA4) tutorial.
